Description
---------------------------
Rainbow Table which reads in a sample of 5000 (can be changed) digests, and compares against 3 (planned) pseudo-randomly generated rainbow tables to find the word which hashes to that particular digest.

Done as part of a school assignment (submitted).

Will be completed at own time (better refinements).
